    // FAQ Page

    frequently_asked_questions: "FAQ",
    faq_title: "FAQ",
    faq1_question:
      "Wie kann ich hundefreundliche Unterkünfte in Europa über Waureisen finden?",
    faq1_answer:
      "Sie können ganz einfach hundefreundliche Unterkünfte mit unseren spezialisierten Suchfiltern finden. Geben Sie einfach Ihr Reiseziel, die Daten ein und wählen Sie 'Reisen mit Hund' in den Suchoptionen. Unsere Plattform bietet über 30 hundespezifische Filter, um Ihnen zu helfen, den perfekten Aufenthalt zu finden, der sowohl Ihren als auch den Bedürfnissen Ihres Hundes entspricht.",
    faq2_question: "Benötige ich eine Reiseversicherung für meinen Hund?",
    faq2_answer:
      "Obwohl es nicht immer obligatorisch ist, empfehlen wir dringend eine Haustier-Reiseversicherung abzuschliessen. Sie kann tierärztliche Notfälle, Reisestornierungen aufgrund von Haustiererkrankungen und andere unerwartete Situationen abdecken. Erkundigen Sie sich bei Ihrem regulären Haustierversicherer nach internationaler Deckung oder erwägen Sie eine spezialisierte Haustier-Reiseversicherung.",
    faq3_question:
      "Welche Einreisebestimmungen gelten für Hunde in den Niederlanden?",
    faq3_answer:
      "Hunde, die in die Niederlande einreisen, müssen einen gültigen EU-Heimtierausweis oder ein tierärztliches Zeugnis, einen Mikrochip, eine aktuelle Tollwutimpfung haben und mindestens 15 Wochen alt sein. Die Tollwutimpfung muss mindestens 21 Tage vor der Reise verabreicht worden sein. Je nach Herkunftsland können zusätzliche Anforderungen gelten.",
    faq4_question:
      "Welches Zubehör sollte ich für meine Reise mit meinem Hund mitbringen?",
    faq4_answer:
      "Wesentliche Gegenstände sind: Leine und Halsband mit ID-Tags, Futter- und Wassernäpfe, vertraute Bettwäsche, Kotbeutel, Pflegeprodukte, regelmässige Medikamente, Kopien der Gesundheitsdokumente und Lieblingsspielzeuge. Für längere Reisen sollten Sie eine tragbare Wasserflasche und zusammenklappbare Näpfe in Betracht ziehen.",
    faq5_question: "Sollte ich vor der Reise einen Tierarzt aufsuchen?",
    faq5_answer:
      "Ja, es wird empfohlen, Ihren Tierarzt 2-4 Wochen vor der Reise zu besuchen. Er kann sicherstellen, dass die Impfungen aktuell sind, notwendige Gesundheitszeugnisse ausstellen, die Reisetauglichkeit Ihres Hundes überprüfen und spezifische Ratschläge basierend auf Ihrem Reiseziel und dem Gesundheitszustand Ihres Hundes geben.",
    faq6_question:
      "Wie kann ich meinen Hund auf eine lange Autofahrt vorbereiten?",
    faq6_answer:
      "Beginnen Sie mit kurzen Autofahrten, um positive Assoziationen aufzubauen. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihr Hund einen komfortablen, sicheren Platz mit vertrauter Bettwäsche hat. Planen Sie regelmässige Pausen alle 2-3 Stunden für Wasser, Toilette und Bewegung ein. Erwägen Sie die Verwendung eines crash-getesteten Auto-Geschirrs oder einer Transportbox für die Sicherheit.",
    faq7_question:
      "Kann ich mit meinem Hund in Spanien öffentliche Verkehrsmittel nutzen?",
    faq7_answer:
      "Die meisten öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel in Spanien erlauben Hunde, aber die Regeln variieren je nach Region und Transportart. Generell sind kleine Hunde in Transportboxen in den meisten Zügen und U-Bahnen erlaubt. Grössere Hunde müssen möglicherweise angeleint und mit Maulkorb versehen sein, und Sie müssen eventuell eine zusätzliche Gebühr zahlen. Überprüfen Sie immer die spezifischen Richtlinien des Transportunternehmens vor der Reise.",
    faq8_question:
      "Werden in allen Unterkünften Futter- und Wassernäpfe für meinen Hund bereitgestellt?",
    faq8_answer:
      "Während viele unserer hundefreundlichen Unterkünfte grundlegende Haustier-Annehmlichkeiten bieten, empfehlen wir, die spezifischen Details der Anzeige zu überprüfen. Einige Unterkünfte bieten komplette Haustier-Pakete einschliesslich Näpfe, Betten und Leckerbissen an, während andere voraussetzen könnten, dass Sie Ihre eigenen Utensilien mitbringen.",
    faq9_question: "Gibt es Hundeverbote an Stränden in Europa?",
    faq9_answer:
      "Der Strandzugang für Hunde variiert je nach Ort und Jahreszeit. Viele europäische Strände haben spezielle hundefreundliche Bereiche oder erlauben Hunde während der Nebensaison/ausserhalb der Hauptzeiten. Einige Strände können den Hundezugang vollständig einschränken, besonders während der Haupttouristensaison. Überprüfen Sie die lokalen Vorschriften für Ihr spezifisches Reiseziel.",
